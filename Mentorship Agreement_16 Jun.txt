WeThinkCode_ Mentorship Agreement

This agreement is to help your group and your mentor align on what your engagement will entail over the next few months. This helps to set you up for success early on.

Use this document to:
    • Agree on frequency and type of communication
    • Define expectations and roles of both parties 
    • Define some specific goals you’d like to achieve through this mentoring relationship.

Communication:
How often will you meet/ communicate for official mentorship meetings? 
Minimum is 1 hour every two weeks but you may choose to connect with your mentor more often.

I think we should start with 1 hour a week as a “required” meeting time. We’ve started with Friday at 12pm but that can change. It would be useful to meet in that format to catch up with goals that we set as a group, like technical improvement. But I find that during second year there’s a few things to juggle especially at the beginning so lets try and fit it within everyone’s shedule.
After chatting in the meeting, we concluded that we would meet once every two weeks. We will change this if necessary after testing it out for a bit.

What channels of communication will you use for your meetings?
Eg. Google Meet, Whats app, Zoom

Google meeting is fine with me, camera’s are optional but I would recommend turning them on.
Google meets for video communication and slack for day to day communication.


Contact outside of official meetings
Is your mentor comfortable/ do they have capacity if you contact them with questions or challenges outside of official meetings?

What platform of communication is suitable?

This is a tricky one. Of course I do this because it’s something I would’ve appreciated when I was in your shoes; I also can’t afford to let my passion burn me out. So I think as you get to know me you’ll understand that I’m not always instantly available But I will always try my best to get back to you guys. My core hours at work are 9am to 3pm (So I would actually appreciate it if we could more our meeting time outside of this, personally I love a good 7am meeting lol).But out side of that I’m available 7am – 9am and then 3pm – 6pm. These are times I can say I’ll be checking Slack and actively responding, But you can always leave a message for me outside of those times and I’ll get back to you. And I think it’s important that we stick to Slack and Google Meets for communication.

As mentees, we will keep contact with Nawa between 7am - 9am and 3pm -6pm. This contact will happen on slack


Expectations and Roles:

Meeting Preparation 

Is there any meeting preparation required for meetings? / Creating an agenda to provide session structure?

Who will be responsible for this?


After the first meeting, we might agree on things we could each do better to improve on something,this doesn’t have to be some incredible achievement but maybe you want to improve you HackRank and and test taking skills, I’m sure I can solve a few of those challenges with your help while I share my screen.

So be prepared to speak, and we’ll use that meeting to report back on what you’ve done in the 2 weeks to improve on the goals you’ll set in the first meeting. Each of you will be responsible for this, I would prefer that you create a system where each week one of you is responsible for finding a tool to send a meeting invite to everyone. Try and practice making it easier for yourself (Automation, hint hint nudge nudge).

Mentees will be responsible for scheduling meetings, and preparation will generally be on a case to case basis.


Recording meeting details and outcomes

Who is responsible for taking notes and sharing next steps after each meeting? 

We suggest this sits with the mentees but up to you all to decide.

I don’t really have a preference but I would be a bit cautious because if we record meetings then some one is responsible for storing those  recordings. Unless someone says otherwise; I’d say we don’t record.

Recordings will happen when appropriate (eg, when there is an important workshop) but we will otherwise try to take notes.



General Expectations for meetings
Ie. What will make for a valuable interaction for both parties?











Mentees:
Meetings will generally take a stand-up format, where we discuss tasks given at the previous meeting, and to receive tasks to complete for the next meeting. On occasion, meetings will be of a workshop format, where Nawa will give us some insight into a topic, like hackerrank tests for example.



Mentor:

I’d hope to see someone master a skill they might have either thought they were comfortable with or are struggling with.

And as someone who is meant to share industry knowledge I know how important it is to be able to communicate effectively, especially early on in your career is this can be something as important as technical skill. 

It sounds like I’m contradicting myself but like with all things there is a balance.






Goals:
Mentee Goals

What are the top 3 things you’d like to achieve through this mentoring relationship?

Discuss as a group and agree upon 3.
We would like to gain some insight into how things run in industry, learn about how to work more professionally with tools such as git and github, and how to balance work and free time more effectively. Additionally, we want to learn more about code conceptualisation: how a project goes from idea to code.







Mentor Goals

What are the top 3 things you’d like to achieve through this mentoring relationship?

I think I’ve answered




Commitment: 
We agree that certain matters shared in these sessions should remain confidential and that we will note when such matters arise. 

We agree to uphold our commitments with reference to the above detail and will communicate with each other timeously if any changes occur.
